          Refund Policy â€“ the basics
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary">
          Having said that, a Refund Policy is a legally binding document that outlines how you
          handle returns, refunds, and exchanges. It helps manage customer expectations and protects
          your business in case of disputes. A clearly written Refund Policy sets forth the conditions
          under which a customer can return a product, get a refund, or request a replacement.
          <br /><br />
          A clear Refund Policy helps reduce misunderstandings and builds trust with your customers.
          Your customers may feel more confident buying from you knowing exactly what your refund
          procedures are, and you may reduce complaints and chargebacks by setting clear terms.

          What to include in the Refund Policy
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary">
          Generally speaking, a Refund Policy often includes details like: the timeframe in which
          customers can request a refund; the condition products must be returned in; whether refunds
          are provided as store credit, replacements, or full money back; who pays for return shipping;
          how long it takes to process refunds; and any items that are non-refundable.
          <br /><br />
          You should tailor the policy to fit your business model and legal requirements in your
          region, and make it easy to understand and accessible on your website.
